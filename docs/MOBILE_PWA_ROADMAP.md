# Mobile Web, PWA, and Offline Access Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the roadmap for enhancing Quizzy to support mobile web browsers, Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities, and robust offline access. The plan maintains the existing IndexedDB-based architecture while adding mobile-friendly features and PWA capabilities.

**Current State:**
- ✅ Desktop web application with React + Chakra UI
- ✅ IndexedDB for local data storage
- ✅ Basic responsive design utilities
- ✅ Full offline data access (IndexedDB)
- ❌ No PWA manifest or service worker
- ❌ Limited mobile optimization
- ❌ No install prompt or app-like experience

**Target State:**
- ✅ Fully responsive mobile-first design
- ✅ PWA with install capabilities
- ✅ Offline-first architecture with service worker
- ✅ Mobile-optimized UI/UX
- ✅ Touch gesture support
- ✅ App-like experience on mobile devices
