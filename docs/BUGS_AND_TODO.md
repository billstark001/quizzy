## High Priority Issues ðŸŸ¡

### 1. ~~Tag System Architectural Issue~~ âœ… COMPLETED

**Status:** âœ… Completed
**Category:** Architecture

The tag system has been successfully migrated from string-based to ID-based architecture in database v6. This provides:
- Centralized tag management

- Tag merging capabilities
- Multilingual support
- Referential integrity

## Medium Priority Issues ðŸŸ¢

### 2. No Server-Side Synchronization

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Medium  
**Category:** Architecture / Features

**Current State:**
- All data stored in browser IndexedDB
- Manual import/export only
- No cross-device sync
- No real-time collaboration

**Impact:**
- Users must manually transfer data between devices
- No backup except manual exports
- Single-device usage only
- Risk of data loss if browser storage cleared

**Proposed Solution:**
- Implement optional cloud backend
- WebSocket for real-time sync
- Conflict resolution for multi-device edits
- Automatic backup
- End-to-end encryption for privacy

**Workaround:**
- Regular manual exports
- Store exports in cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Import on other devices

### 3. ~~Search Index Rebuild Performance~~ âœ… COMPLETED

**Status:** âœ… Completed
**Category:** Performance

The search index rebuild performance has been optimized with incremental indexing. Search indices are only updated for entities with the `searchCacheInvalidated` flag, significantly improving performance.

### 4. No Attachment Support

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Medium  
**Category:** Features

**Current State:**
- Only text and markdown supported
- No image upload
- No PDF attachments
- External images via URL only

**Impact:**
- Cannot include diagrams locally
- Dependent on external image hosting
- No offline image support
- Limited question types (e.g., image-based questions)

**Proposed Solution:**
- File attachment system
- Base64 encoding for small images
- IndexedDB blob storage
- Image optimization
- PDF viewer integration

**Workaround:**
- Host images externally (imgur, image hosting services)
- Use base64 data URLs (not recommended for large images)
- Link to external documents

### 5. Limited Localization

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Medium  
**Category:** Internationalization

**Current State:**
- English interface
- Tag localization partially implemented
- No language switching
- Date/time formatting not localized

**Impact:**
- Limited accessibility for non-English users
- Harder adoption in non-English regions
- Tag system supports multilingual but UI doesn't

**Proposed Solution:**
- Full i18n implementation
- RTL language support
- Localized date/time
- Community translations
- Language switcher in UI

**Workaround:**
- Use browser translation
- English-only interface
- Manual translation of content

## Low Priority Issues ðŸ”µ

### 6. No Keyboard Shortcuts

**Status:** ðŸ”µ Low  
**Category:** UX

**Description:** No keyboard shortcuts for common operations (save, navigate, search).

**Workaround:** Use mouse/touch interface.

---

### 7. No Dark Mode Preference Persistence

**Status:** ðŸ”µ Low  
**Category:** UI

**Description:** Dark mode preference not saved between sessions.

**Workaround:** Manually toggle each session.

---

### 8. Limited Question Type Extensibility

**Status:** ðŸ”µ Low  
**Category:** Architecture

**Description:** Adding new question types requires core changes.

**Proposed Solution:** Plugin system for custom question types.

---

### 9. No Undo/Redo for Edits

**Status:** ðŸ”µ Low  
**Category:** Features

**Description:** Cannot undo question/paper edits.

**Workaround:** Export before major changes.

---

### 10. Browser Storage Limits

**Status:** ðŸ”µ Low  
**Category:** Limitation

**Description:** IndexedDB has browser-dependent storage limits.

**Workaround:** Regular exports, delete old records.
